    " - **the ode itself**, this has to be provided by the user as the right hand side functor or tuple of functors including the solver method if an implicit stepper is used and then tied to a single object typically using `std::tie`, e.g. `std::tie( ex, im, solve);`\n",
    " - **the timeloop** (adaptive timestep vs fixed timestep) -> can be implemented by the user or in Feltor represented by an instance of `dg::aTimeloop` class (useful if one wants to choose a method at runtime) e.g. `dg::AdaptiveTimeloop<Vector>`. The timeloop includes the **initial condition** and the integration boundaries (these are the paramters to the integrate function) `timeloop.integrate( t0, u0, t1, u1);`\n",
    " .\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dg` library provides a wide selection of explicit, implicit and imex timesteppers:\n",

    "All of the above classes are templates of the Vector type in use. Chosing an appropriate type for the integration variable(s) is usually the first decision to make when implementing a differential equation. Anything that works in the `dg::blas1` functions is allowed so check out the [Vectors](sec:vectors) chapter.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "For any explicit (part of the) equation we need to solve the first and for any implicit (part of the) equation  we need to solve both the first and the second equation.\n",
