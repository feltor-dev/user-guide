In fact, the matrix does not need to be known at all, in code or analytically. The only thing that is needed is the **application** of the matrix to a vector. In other words, the solver just needs a \"black box\" that takes a vector on one side and spits out a vector on the other side. Linearity is just a promise of the \"black box\" (which our solvers blindly trust).\n",
