    "As a binary output format we recommend [netCDF-4](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/). This format is widely used and bases on the HDF5 data format. Even though netCDF-4 offers an enhanced data model we usually do not create groups in files. In short, we use netcdf-4 for its HDF5 compatibility but only write the [The classic data model](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_data_model.html#classic_model) consisting of _Variables_, _Dimensions_ and _Attributes_.\n",
    "```{admonition} Conventions\n",
    "We usually provide Meta-data in the file based on the [CF-conventions](https://cfconventions.org/) and [netCDF-conventions](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/documentation/NUG/best_practices.html). See the [Create your own project](sec:project) page for more details on how to do this in practice.\n",

The data for \"x\" and \"y\" is written directly to file and is generated from the Gaussian nodes of the grid in x and y directly.

The only issue when writing data to file is what to do in an MPI setting where the data is distributed among processes.
